                    Hack Cyprus was created by Cypriot Enterprise Link, with a clear ambition in mind — putting Cyprus on the
                        technology map. We think Cyprus is able to attract and produce world-class technologists, and we
                        envision Cyprus being a prominent startup hub in Europe and the world.

                    Kotlin is a new open-source language for the JVM (and Javascript), created by Jetbrains (IntelliJ, Android Studio, WebStorm, PyCharm etc). It has been used as a drop-in replacement for Java in its various applications, but great emphasis has been given in its potential for developing Android apps. As of 2017, Kotlin is officially supported by Google as a first-class citizen of the Android developer toolchain, which means its popularity will only rise.
                </p>    
                <p>    
                Notable features include:<br>
                - 100% compatibility with Java and all existing Java libraries<br>
                - Nullable types<br>
                - Extension functions<br>
                - Functional paradigms<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                We'll be going through what makes hacking in Kotlin fun, how it can make the life of Android developers a lot easier, and how we can write better, more readable, more maintainable code.

                </p><p>    
                # SQL Injection - not using parameterized queries / prepared statements <br>
                # Cross-Site Scripting - no output encoding / not taking into account the context <br>
                # Access controls - authentication vs authorization / exposing internal resources and not binding to sessions<br>
                # Session Management - Insecure session termination / cookie scoping and attributes / session fixation <br>
                # Cross-Site Request Forgery - not using anti-CSRF protection ---> impact <br>
                # Insecure Password storage -> not HASHING passwords but either encrypting them or storing them in plaintext <br>
                # Directory Traversal - not limiting the root of the application <br>
                </p><p>    
                The workshop will be carried out in the following format:

                - Explain the pitfall and the vulnerability it leads to.
                - Explain how to exploit the vulnerability and discuss impact
                - Demonstrate exploitation
                - Give time to participants to exploit vulnerability.
                </p><p>    
                All pitfalls will have demos. We will use an online 'training' environment which will be available for a few days after the event in case participants

                <p>Vasilis is a senior software engineer at Rentalcars.com .He moved around a lot of projects and teams but his constant responsibility was to build high performance systems. His work highlights involve building a distributed cache for the webapp backend and developing a low response time microservice which is the inspiration for this talk.
</p><p>
He has mainly worked with Java, Scala and Akka along with various AWS technologies. On his free time he works on personal and 3rd party open source projects or video streaming programming paradigms. On his real free time he plays football, table tennis or road tripping.
                </p>
                <p><b>Talk Summary:</b>
In the world of microservices, the need for distribution, high availability and optimal performance imply high level technology debt both in terms of infrastructure and code while they promise to reduce the technical depth of service monoliths. 
</p><p>
Are there any paradigms that guide us into building high performing and highly available services? What are the needs of containerisation , partitioned networking and service discovery? Do all these considerations worth the effort of building a contained, domain specific service?
</p><p>
The problem at hand is the requirement for a low latency , highly available microservice. To achieve this the need for partitioned network leads us to a world of eventual consistency due to the CAP theorem barrier . What are the assumptions that are necessary to achieve such a goal? How do we tackle the complexity of the technology choices from infrastructure to programming languages?
</p><p>
The paradigm discussed is inspired by Command Query Responsibility Segragation pattern (CQRS) using Akka (http://akka.io) to achieve a low response time, always available domain specific distributed cache. The results were astounding with 95th percentile response times being at 32ms . The combination of AWS services such as kinesis, dynamodb and ecs along with Akka and docker composed a complex but reusable solution to build containirised, clustered, always available, low response time services.

                    Simos Gerasimou is a Research Associate at the High-Integrity Systems Engineering research group
                    within the Department of Computer Science at the University of York. He received his BSc in Computer
                    Science from the University of Cyprus, Cyprus, in 2010, and his MSc in Software Engineering and PhD
                    in Computer Science from the University of York, UK, in 2011 and 2017, respectively. His research
                    interests lie in the area of self-adaptive and autonomous systems with a focus on methods that enable
                    dependable system adaptation. Other research interests include runtime quantitative verification,
                    search-based software engineering, model-driven engineering, robotics and artificial intelligence.
                </p>
                <p><b>Talk Summary: </b>
                    An increasing number of software systems is developed using publicly available/ 
third-party products (i.e., frameworks and libraries). Many of these products 
provide robust and efficient functionalities that are available through Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs). Although the use of APIs enhances modularity, reduces 
development time and increases the quality of software systems, it also reinforces 
the dependency of these systems on third-party software.
</p><p>
Since both software systems and products evolve independently, dependent software 
systems will likely encounter obsolescence issues during their lifetime. For instance, 
new requirements or improved software designs lead to product updates, and thus to API 
modifications, that often break compliance with dependent systems. Developers must select 
between the costly process of adapting a software system to resolve these obsolescence 
issues versus dealing with the imminent problems arising from using obsolete software 
(e.g., bugs, security risks).
</p><p>
In this presentation, we review recent work towards the automated resolution of these 
obsolescence problems and introduce a semi-automated software modernisation methodology for 
dealing with the problem of API obsolescence. The methodology comprises a set of stages 
that includes software system analysis, discovery and compatibility assessment of new 
libraries, data visualisation, mapping inference and application of modernisation pattern, 
and finally source code population. We applied the methodology to four different demonstrators 
that involve library upgrade, hardware infrastructure update and hardware migration. Using 
these demonstrators, we analysed the methodology and extracted several qualitative and 
quantitative features including extensibility, engineering effort and scalability. Finally, 
we reasoned about the considerations that stakeholders should make to determine whether to 
proceed or not with the modernisation.

                <p><b> Talk Summary:</b>
                Laravel is one of the most famous PHP frameworks out there. Some of the reasons include its responsiveness, ease of use and great communication from the team which created it. Building a great application using Laravel though can be challenging and sometimes overwhelming. We've learned that first hand at Softline Computer Systems (softline.com.cy) where we started developing our main software solution, Zygos (getzygos.com) totally based on Laravel, almost 4 years ago. We have faced a lot of challenges  and obstacles that many Laravel developers, have faced in large web applications. We want to share these experiences with others and help them get an idea of how Laravel works and which are the best practices.
